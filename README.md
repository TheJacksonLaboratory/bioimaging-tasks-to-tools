# Bioimage analysis tasks to tools guide

The goal of this guide is to provide a quick reference for selecting the right open source tool for a given bioimage analysis task. It's intended to help with getting started with a project, particularly for new comers to (bio)image analysis. The guide is organized by common tasks, such as manual annotation, segmentation, tracking, colocalization, etc., and for each task, a list of commonly used tools is provided. At the end of the guide, there are brief overview descriptions of the tools.  
The guide is not exhaustive: at present the focus is on tools that offer a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, but in the future, we may expand to include command-line tools and libraries. Likewise, suggested tools or plugins are those that are well-supported, have a large user base, and are actively maintained, such that you can easily find help if needed. Where possible we have linked to tutorials or documentation to help you get started.

Conversion to SharePoint:
1. Push changes to GitHub and open the rendered Preview in GitHub.
2. Copy the rendered content.
3. Paste the content into the Text web part in the SharePoint page.
4. Select all of the text and use the `...` "more styles" menu to access `Line spacing`.
5. Set the line spacing to `1.6` and then for `Paragraph spacing` add spacing both before and after.
6. For each relative link to a tool, e.g. Fiji, fix the link to just be the anchor (`#fiji`) without the GitHub url.
