title: "Bioimage analysis tasks-to-tools guide"
---

The goal of this guide is to provide a quick reference for selecting the right open-source tool for a given bioimage analysis task.  
It is organized by common tasks, such as manual annotation, segmentation, tracking, colocalization, etc., and for each task, a list of commonly used tools is provided.  
For more information, please see the [About this project](about.md) page.

::::: {.grid}

:::: {.g-col-6}


::: {.callout-note .clickable-callout data-href="manual_annotation" icon="false"}

# Manually annotating regions of interest:

an important image analysis step, for example to indicate regions of interest (ROI) for further analysis or to provide ground-truth for training machine learning (ML) models

:::: {.g-col-6}

::: {.callout-note .clickable-callout data-href="segmentation" icon="false"}
# Automated segmentation of regions of interest:

involves breaking up an image into regions of interest (ROIs) based on pixel intensity values, texture, shape, etc. rather than by manually annotating them

::: {.callout-note .clickable-callout data-href="tracking" icon="false"}

# Tracking cells and particles:

an essential component of analyzing time-lapse studies, it involves detecting and labeling objects frame-by-frame and then linking the objects between frames

::: {.callout-note .clickable-callout data-href="colocalization" icon="false"}
# Colocalization analysis:

aims to quantify the degree of overlap between two or more channels in an image, for example representing subcellular fluorescence markers

## Getting more help

All of tools discussed here are part of the [image.sc community](https://forum.image.sc), which hosts varied discussions ranging from beginner questions to in-depth bug troubleshooting. Likewise, all of the tasks are well within scope of image.sc discussions. In addition to posting questions or leading discussions, the effective `Search`, including `Advanced filters`, enables easy mining of this rich resource. Finally, [the image.sc Announcements board](https://forum.image.sc/c/announcements/10) is a great way to keep up with the latest bioimaging tool developments.
