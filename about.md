## What

* The goal of this guide is to provide a quick reference for selecting the right open-source tool for a given bioimage analysis task. 
* It is intended to help with getting started with a project, particularly for newcomers to (bio)image analysis.
* It is organized by common tasks, such as manual annotation, segmentation, tracking, colocalization, etc., and for each task, a list of commonly used tools is provided. Finally, the guide includes brief overview descriptions of the tools.
* Where possible we have linked to tutorials or documentation to help you get started.

## Please note that the guide is *not exhaustive*!
At present, the focus is on tools that offer a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, but in the future, we may expand to include command-line tools and libraries. Likewise, the focus is on tools or plugins that are well-supported, have a large user base, and are actively maintained, such that it is easy to find help if needed.
